* Deflating
  - Get ScyPy erode function to work on the costmap
  - If not work: Implement edge detection + tangent binarization
  - If not work: Implement manhattan distance to edge
* Collecting data
  - Collect data in atrium
  - Collect data in lab
    + need to make a task to navigate waypoints
    + need to add waypoints to map
* Detecting static objects
  - Try subtracting entropy from costmap
  - Average costmap
  - Normalized costmap?
* How to update the map
* Writing
  - Write some sort of summary
